  Generative photo-editing is now a reality! Powered by deep-learning, the
  Neural-Photo-Editor takes image manipulation to the next level by extending
  the notion of context-aware-fill to a far more nuanced understanding of
  the images being edited. Adversarial models power the impressive
  capabilities of the interface. Will something like this appear in the next
  version of Photoshop?
