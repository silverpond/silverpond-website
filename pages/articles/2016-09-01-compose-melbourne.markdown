Silverpond made an appearance at
[Compose :: Melbourne](http://www.composeconference.org/)
on Monday and Tuesday this week.
Noon, Andy and I helped organise the event and other Silverponders came
along on the day to watch.

We have a great interest in functional-programming, so we want to see the
Melbourne community grow and flourish. Compose :: Melbourne was conceived
with this idea in mind. The turnout was fantastic and we all had a great
time.

We also took some pictures!
