  Stripe has written a guide to Machine-Learning aimed at giving
  users of "Radar", their fraud-detection toolbox an understanding
  of the techniques that they are leveraging to help combat
  payments-fraud. While this guide doesn't cover advanced concepts
  from machine-learning, it should still provide a useful introduction,
  especially to those who's interest comes from a desire to gain
  insight into how machine-learning is employed in Stripe's services.
