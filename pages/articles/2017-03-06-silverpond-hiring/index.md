## In General

Although the details of a position at Silverpond will depend
on the kind of work being undertaken, we value several traits
highly and they can be considered applicable across all roles...


### T-Shaped

At Silverpond we're interested in a wide range of domains and appreciate
colleagues with similarly diverse interests. A diverse set of interests and skills gives perspective, prevents echo-chamber effects and allows us to think outside of the box.
That being said, we also value having deep expertise in at least
one area. This shows that an individual is capable of digging into the details, theory and perculiarities of a subject when required.

### Problem Solver

The ability to focus on finding a solution to the problem
at hand is very useful to us. Although we love thinking about the
theory behind what we're currently working on, we are pragmatists at 
heart. Especially when working with clients, we find it valuable to design
effective solutions quickly, and improve upon them to design elegant final products.

### Communications / Collaboration

One of the bedrocks of our organisation is clear communication.
Everything from the meetings and events that we hold, to the software
that we write is intended to communicate in some fashion. As consultants, 
we are both facilitators and problem solvers. Effective communication 
is not only part of our day-to-day, it is what set us apart.   

### Initiative

The ability to take initiative _and start initiatives_ is a big part
of what it means to be a Silverponder. This refers to our role in the
both the workplaces as well as the communities that we participate in.
We appreciate strong opinions backed by deep understanding on which 
solutions are best, as well as a passionate drive to see them through. 

### Self-Learning

While we run several internal groups, public meetups, workshops, and
have the opportunity to pick up a great deal of knowledge on the projects
which we work, a powerful thirst for knowlege and learning is a trait
shared by Silverponders that has helped us all become proficient
in our work and interests. If you share this with us then Silverpond
is very flexible in helping you not only build your knowledge, but also
apply it and turn your interests into your work.

## Diversity

We are committed to diversity. We would like to see a more
balanced tech community, and strongly encourage women and people of
all backgrounds to apply. 

If you think you can bring something new to our team then we would love to
hear from you!
