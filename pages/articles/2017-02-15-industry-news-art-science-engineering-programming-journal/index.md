  There has been a gap in the Journal landscape. While there have been
  pleanty of journals relating to computer-science, mathematics, and
  related fields, there hasn't been one dedicated to computer-programming...
  until now! This new offering aims to fill the gap, with its stated
  purpose being
  "The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming is a new journal created
  with the goal of placing the wonderful art of programming in the map of
  scholarly works".
