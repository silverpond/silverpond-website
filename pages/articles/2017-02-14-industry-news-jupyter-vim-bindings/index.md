  For those of us who have a modal-brain, there is now the possibility of using
  our favorite editor's key-bindings in Jupyter-Notebooks! The notebook environment
  provides a different take on exploratory development by crafting code as a document
  with text and results interspersed. This has proven especially popular in the
  data-science community, where data-visualisation and rapid feedback is extremely
  important when developing analysis and algorithms. Unfortunately, the de-facto
  notebook interface - "Jupyter" - is often a shocking departure from our preference in
  text-editing interface. No longer!
