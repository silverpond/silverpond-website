<em>
	Guest reviewer <a href="http://paul.bone.id.au">Paul Bone</a> presents a few thoughts on
	Richard Jones's "The Garbage Collection Handbook":
</em>

There are a number of topics within computer science that many
developers regard as "magical", thinking "oh, I could never implement
that, or understand that".  There are also topics that seem to attract
a lot of misinformation.  Garbage collection is both of these and
Richard Jones' Garbage Collection Handbook is the solution.

This is the first text book I have ever read (almost) cover-to-cover, I
found the topic fascinating and the book explained it well, starting
with simple algorithms and building up to descriptions of many
state-of-the-art collectors.  Jones also maintains online resources and
a bibliography of garbage collection related information.
