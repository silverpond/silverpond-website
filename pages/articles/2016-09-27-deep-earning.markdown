Silverpond runs
[ four-hour deep-learning workshops.](http://silverpond.com.au/workshops)
We want to share our knowledge
because machine learning and deep-learning will change how we use software to
solve problems. We have a technical understanding of the concepts and mechanisms
involved in deep-learning, but we also have a vision for how industry
adoption of deep-learning will change the way data scientists and software
engineers work in the future.

Why would a business care about deep-learning?

<!--more-->

It's worth considering the following advantages of having an
in-house understanding of deep-learning concepts. While your
business may not traditionally have played in the machine-learning
space, some of the barriers to this space, or motivations for
entering have changed recently with the advent of accessible
and effective deep-learning techniques.

Hard reasons:

* Analysis of previously inaccessible data
* Learned features
* Human-Level intelligence deployed at scale
* Reuse / retraining of existing models

Soft reasons:

* Industry trends
* Informed Recruitment / HR
* Informed Management
* Signalling

## Hard reasons

There are strong technical reasons for adopting deep-learning.
Advantages in terms of new capabilities and competitive
edges spring from increased analytic capacity and new automation
opportunities.

### Analysis of previously inaccessible data

Until recently, business intelligence, prediction, and recommendations
were heavily constrained by available metadata and sophisticated and
time-consuming hand-coded heuristics. Deep-learning makes the analysis
of new data-types possible, opening the black-boxes of textual, graphical
and time-series analysis to the business for profit opportunities
and cost-control.

### Learned features

The construction of feature-analysis in traditional machine-learning and
hand-coding of heuristic methods was time-consuming, required
subject-matter-experts, and did not adapt to changes in the world that
broke your assumptions. Deep-learning models can mitigate these issues
by learning "end-to-end" how to construct conceptual embeddings of
your problem domains and how to best leverage this to provide you with
predictions and answers. Construction of interoperable networks will
even allow you to gain business-domain understanding from the models that you
have trained.

### Human-level intelligence deployed at scale

Given that deep-learning can enable machines to tackle previously
intractable problems that required specialised human analysis,
the major implication for a business is that this capability is
now scalable. Buy more servers; predict and classify more, faster.
Your ability to scale up operations can now be planned in terms of
minutes as opposed to the months required for recruitment / training.

### Reuse / retraining of existing models

Although deep-learning greatly commoditizes the notion of training
through the concept of "end-to-end" learning, you can also take
advantage of the great wealth of existing pre-trained networks
available for commercial use for free. To foster the ecosystem
and promote their use of these techniques, giants like Google
and Facebook have made many of their trained models available
for use by the public. Your business can take advantage of this
by applying the use of these models where they fit exactly, and
retraining the models (at greatly reduced cost) where they fit approximately.

## Soft reasons

While the technical reasons should be extremely compelling on their
own, there are also "softer" reasons why gaining a working
understanding of deep-learning may be a good idea for a business.

### Industry trends

There is no denying that deep-learning is extremely hot right now
and that many companies, large-and-small, are adopting the
techniques to extend their capabilities and gain a competitive edge.
Even if you do not end up using deep-learning in your business
it makes sense to be informed enough so that you can make the
decision intelligently rather than defaulting because of
a lack of understanding of what deep-learning can and cannot offer you.

### Informed Recruitment / HR

<img title="https://www.flickr.com/photos/theslowlane/29109445903/in/photolist-6d3MGc-Lmiw7k-8ZJt2D-8ZDfdt-bdd2Kx-76R5Yv" src="/img/blog/deep-earning/hr.png" />

If you do decide to invest in a deep-learning capability for your business,
then you will undoubtedly need to acquire the skills of talented
individuals to aid you in your journey. Either through hiring, or
by enlisting the services of consultants. If you want to be able
to evaluate the sophistication of these individuals then it makes
sense that you should have an understanding, or at least a good
intuition for the concepts involved, so that you can evaluate
expected performance accurately.

### Informed Management

Likewise, when you have built a talented deep-learning team, you
should be able to make best use of their efforts, cultivate their
growth, and curate the composition of the team to maximise effectiveness.
An understanding of deep-learning will also allow you to identify
upcoming trends that will allow for strategic research to best
plan your strategic roadmap.

### Signalling

Finally, by being on the cutting edge of trends such as deep-learning
your business signals that it is a savvy operator and is investing
in future growth. This can appeal both to customers, who want to ensure
that their service-providers will stay relevant in the future, and
to investors, who want to foster the growth of businesses who are
well placed to take advantage of emerging capabilities.
