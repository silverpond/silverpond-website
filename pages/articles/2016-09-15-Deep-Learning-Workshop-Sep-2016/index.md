If you have basic Python skills and don’t mind maths, this hands-on workshop
will give you the basic knowledge you need to start your first deep learning
project.

Be warned – this is not a superficial overview like other courses out there –
expect to get your hands dirty in math, Python and TensorFlow.

Outcomes:

* An intuitive understanding of the components of machine learning systems
* Experience building neural networks in TensorFlow
* Practice in representation learning and word embeddings

**When:**
2 – 6PM WED 28 SEP 2016

**Where:**
SILVERPOND OFFICE
Level 1, 382 Little Collins Street
Melbourne, Australia

**How much:**
$250 + GST

Finally, as we love our community, we will be offering a free preview workshop
to members of the [Melbourne Machine Learning and AI
Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Machine-Learning-AI-Meetup/) on Wed 21 Sep. 

We look forward to seeing you there!
