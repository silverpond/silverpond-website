title: Inaugural Deep-Learning Show & Tell!
author: Lyndon Maydwell
meta: |
  As part of Silverpond's deep-learning workshops, we commit to running
  show-and tell sessions where previous attendees can show of projects
  they have been working on using the deep-learning techniques we've
  taught.

Silverpond ran its first deep-learning show-and-tell session on Tuesday this week.
We've run three deep-learning workshops to date, and we extended an invitation to
people who had attended any of these previous events.

<!--more-->

We had 3 full-talks and 2 lightning-talks at this event with lots of discussion
in post-talk Q&A and post-event socialising:

* Talk: "Image Classification with Deep Learning" - Drop-out; Tune-in!
* Talk: "Adjustable Readers" - Writing stories with AI.
* Talk: "Single Shot Multibox" - Fast and accurate non-RCNN object-location.
* Lightning Talk: "Ship Learning" - Inferring ship-safety with deep-learning.
* Lightning Talk: "AI Retirement Plan" - Can we address AI-driven redundancy?

We feel that it is important to put what's learned at our workshops into practice.
This is why we run the show-and-tell sessions - to provide a further incentive
to take steps towards using deep-learning professionally day-to-day.

If you're interested in learning about deep-learning, then consider attending
one of [Silverpond's upcoming deep-learning workshops](/workshops).
