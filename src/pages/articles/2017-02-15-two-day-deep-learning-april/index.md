Silverpond have
[scheduled our next deep-learning workshop](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/deep-learning-2-day-workshop-tickets-32036837042)
and there is a **big change** in store! We've extended the event by adding a second-day
to the workshop. This will allow for greater breathing room in the content,
as well as the addition of further exercieses and allow us to set aside a large
chunk of time to build a complete project from scratch, in groups.

After running several deep-learning workshops at Silverpond, one consistent
piece of feedback that we received was that the amount of content included was
ambitious given only a single-day of attendance. This limited the amount of
time that attendees could spend on exercises and prevented us from providing
guidance relating to the construction of real-world projects. While feedback
has been very positive, we feel that we could greatly enhance the value
Silverpond can provide by including a second day for the workshop.  The second
day will focus less on fundamentals and concepts, and more on putting together
real code-bases intended to accomplish deep-learning heavy-lifting.

If you're keen to take advantage of the head-start that our new extended
workshop can provide for you then it's worth noting that we are
offering a limited number of early-bird tickets until the end of February, so
grab one now!
