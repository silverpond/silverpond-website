[Deep-scite](https://github.com/silky/deep-scite)

Just in time for the
[Deep-Learning Workshop](/2016/09/15/Deep-Learning-Workshop-Sep-2016.html)
Noon has open-sourced [DeepScite](https://github.com/silky/deep-scite)!

DeepScite is a recommendation-engine tailored for use with [SciRate](https://scirate.com/)
and the [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/). It uses deep-learning to provide interoperable recommendations
for new academic papers and is now in use for the weekly SciRate-recommendations
newsletter.

At the Silverpond [Deep Learning Workshop](http://silverpond.com.au/workshops) we make extensive use of DeepScite as
an example for learning about embeddings, convolutions, interoperability, and
Tensorflow. Participants are encouraged to train the DeepScite network, and
use DeepScite to perform inference on articles for recommendation.

If you come along to the [workshop next week](/2016/09/15/Deep-Learning-Workshop-Sep-2016.html) then you too will be
guided through the rationale and operation of the DeepScite tool, but until
then you can dive straight into the source on GitHub!
