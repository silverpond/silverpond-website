As you can see, we've revamped our website...

There were a few reasons for this:

* To create a section for our co-working space
* To make the site more collaborative
* To reflect the feel of Silverpond accurately

We're now hosting on Github-Pages. This should make it
easier to collaborate, as we won't need a custom
build-pipeline, and deployment becomes a piece of cake.

The co-working space is very exciting. We moved office
recently and have a whole floor free. We're keen to turn
this into a co-working space called "The Pond". Part of
what we need to do to make this happen is to create a
landing page to send people to when we refer to the new
space. And so, you can now visit [The Pond](/the-pond)'s
landing page!

Currently we are sanding the floors on Level 1. Despite a whole lot of sawdust, we are optimistic about how it will look when complete!

We also feel that Silverpond has changed fairly substantially
over the last few years. We're not making as many Rails apps
as we used to. We're working with larger clients on harder
problems. Our focus has broardened to include data-science and
research, as well as embracing functional-programming and
other special-purpose technologies.

[Andy](/team#andy-kitchen) put in the hard yards of the re-design and it was all looking pretty great, but then he added
a boids simulation and it was just _right._
